## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
use("TraMineR")
data(mvad)
mvad.labels <- c("employment", "further education", "higher education",
                    "joblessness", "school", "training")
mvad.scodes <- c("EM","FE","HE","JL","SC","TR")
mvad.seq <- seqdef(mvad, 15:86, states=mvad.scodes, labels=mvad.labels)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}

om <- seqdist(mvad.seq, method="OM", indel=1, sm="CONSTANT") 
```

```{r}
library(WeightedCluster)

## Perform hierarchical clustering using "ward.D" method, the input is the OM-based dissimilarity matrix (specified in as.dist)
wardCluster <- hclust(as.dist(om), method="ward.D")

## as.clustrange() produces the all the quality indices 
wardRange<-as.clustrange(wardCluster, diss=om)

## print the quality indices for the two best solutions
summary(wardRange, max.rank=2)

```
