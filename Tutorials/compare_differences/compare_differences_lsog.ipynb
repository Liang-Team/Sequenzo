    "This tutorial shows how to use **Sequenzo's compare_differences** module with the **LSOG dyadic_children** dataset. You will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup** — Load data and build a `SequenceData` object\n",
    "2. **Position-wise Analysis** — Analyze how group differences evolve across positions using sliding windows\n",
    "3. **Overall Comparison** — Compare groups using likelihood ratio tests and Bayesian information criterion\n",
    "4. **Visualization** — Plot group differences across positions\n",
    "5. **Interpretation** — Understand the statistics and their meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "The `compare_differences` module provides two main types of analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Position-wise Discrepancy Analysis** (`compare_groups_across_positions`): Analyzes how differences between groups evolve along positions using sliding windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequence Comparison Tests** (`compare_groups_overall`, `compute_likelihood_ratio_test`, `compute_bayesian_information_criterion_test`): Performs likelihood ratio tests and Bayesian information criterion tests to compare groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "All functions return pandas DataFrames or NumPy arrays that you can use for further analysis. The API is designed to be consistent with **TraMineR** where applicable."
